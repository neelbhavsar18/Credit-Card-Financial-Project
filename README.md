Credit Card Financial Dashboard using Power BI and MySQL
 
I’m excited to introduce a Credit Card Financial Dashboard I’ve developed using Power BI and MySQL. This tool provides real-time insights into essential performance metrics like revenue growth, transaction volumes, and customer contributions, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions with confidence.

### Project Overview:
1. **Data Preparation**: Transformed and organized CSV files into a structured SQL database, ensuring clean, accessible tables for transaction and customer data.
2. **Dashboard Creation**: Built a dynamic, interactive dashboard in Power BI, utilizing DAX queries to calculate key metrics, including revenue, transaction counts, and customer segmentation.
3. **Insights Sharing**: Exported and distributed the dashboard to relevant stakeholders for ongoing monitoring and strategic decision-making.

### Key Metrics Uncovered:
- **Total Revenue**: $57M
- **Total Interest**: $8M
- **Transaction Volume**: $46M
- **Male vs. Female Contribution**: $31M vs. $26M
- **Businessman Contribution**: $18M
- **Blue & Silver Cards**: 93% of total transactions

This project not only showcases my technical skills in Power BI and SQL but also my ability to deliver actionable insights that drive business success.
